Marie cannot take showers this week, because she broke her arm. Her mother helps her, and her brother runs her errands so she can rest.

They talked last month, but this month Patricia said she did not have any more minutes on her cell phone and that she could not call. So Marie is said and bored. She does not know what she could do to entertain herself. She does not like reading, and her mother does not want her to watch TV all the time. She thinks, «I would like someone to help me ! »
