Last summer our favorite restaurant burned down. We don't know what happened. Everything was quiet, and all of a sudden the fire started. We saw the rubble on TV and we were sad, because we liked that restaurant. What a horrible thingÂ ! There were always a lot of people and the atmosphere was nice. One day, a dance teacher taught a salsa lesson, and we had a good time. I would like to know what the owners want to do now. I hope they rebuild soon.
