Tomorrow, as soon as I arrive at work, I will clean up my desk. When I left last night, I did not put anything away, because I did not have time. My husband called me because he had forgotten his keys this morning. He was waiting for me in front of the houseÂ ! So I had to leave quickly to go help him. But I don't like to leave my stuff lying around. I like things to be well-organized.
