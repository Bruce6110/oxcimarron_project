Julie is the girl that Marc met last Saturday. She's an American, but she comes from Jamaica. She has lived in Kingston for 6 years. Her father bought a coffee plantation in the mountains 6 years ago. They have a lot of money, and she travels in all the countries of the world. When she arrived in France, she went to Paris, and she bought a small apartment that's comfortable. The building her apartment is in is old, but it is in good shape. She has all the comfort that she needs.
