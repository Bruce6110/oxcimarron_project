Last Tuesday, Julie went to the dentist's. She does not like that dentist. He is brutal, and each time she goes there, her teeth hurt afterwards. She is looking for another dentist. She hopes that she will soon be able to change. For now, she is suffering. She knows that teeth left untreated can become a big problem. For instance, Julie's uncle had a lot of problems a year ago. In general, it is necessary to go to the dentist once a year. It is not pleasant, but it is necessary to have healthy teeth.
