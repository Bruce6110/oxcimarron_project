My grandmother Jeanne was an extraordinary woman. She was born in 1920 in Nice, a town in the south of France. Her father was a doctor, and her mother was taking care of the poor and the homeless of the town.  She would give them food when they were hungry, and in the winter, when they were sick, she had medications for them. The days when she did not have school. Jeanne would go with her mother. When she grew up and finished high school, she decided to go to Paris. There, she went to college because she wanted to become a doctor like her father. There weren't many women in college at that time. It was quite an extraordinary thing when a women went to college. But as soon as she started, the war with Germany began. Her parents wanted her to come home to Nice, because they thought that Paris would be too dangerous. But she wanted to stay there to help the people who were miserable because of the war. Like her mother, she watned to help those who suffer. She became a nurse at the hospital. That is where she met my grandfather. At the beginning, she felt neither friendship nor affection for him, but little by little, she started to love him...and after the way they got married. Unfortunately, my grandfather had an accident and died rather young. Jeanne never remarried.
