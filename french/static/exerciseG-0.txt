I am in my first year of college. I think that it is fairly difficult but I make the effort, I will succeed. The other students that I have met told me I should not worry. These students proposed to study together at the university library. They are very nice, and I am glad to know them. I have a nice apartment that I share with another student. He is very nice, and we practice judo together. He does not like his studies. He prefers to play sports all the time. I want to succeed. I work a lot. The class that is hard for me is the Italian class. That class is on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:30 a.m.  I would like to learn Italian, but I would prefer a class that is not in the morning.
