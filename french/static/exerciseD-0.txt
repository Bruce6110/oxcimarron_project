If I were an athlete, my life would be as hard as it would be rewarding. I would have to get up very early every morning to go train. I hate getting up early. Before leaving the house, I would have to have breakfast : it is necessary for an athlete to have strength. What is good for an athlete's breakfast ? I think that eggs and cereal are good for my health. If I won a medal at the Olympic Games one day, I could retire and live happily ever after (literally, until the end of my life)
