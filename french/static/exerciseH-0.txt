Last Saturday we flew to Dallas to see a painting exhibit. I had not been in a museum in two years. There are no museums in the city we live in. At the Dallas museum, there were a lot of people and we waited for a long time before we got in.  In the museum, it was very cold because Americans like air conditioning. We liked the exhibit, but when we got out, it was very hot and, because of the difference with the inside temperature, I caught a cold. When we came home, I went to bed right away and I slept for ten hours. What a tripÂ !
